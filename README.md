This is the code repository for [Generative Adversarial Networks Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/generative-adversarial-networks-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789139907 ), published by Packt.

**Over 100 recipes to build generative models using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras**

## What is this book about?
Developing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a complex task, and it is often hard to find code that is easy to understand.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Structure a GAN architecture in pseudocode 
Understand the common architecture for each of the GAN models you will build 
Implement different GAN architectures in TensorFlow and Keras 
Use different datasets to enable neural network functionality in GAN models 
Combine different GAN models and learn how to fine-tune them 
Produce a model that can take 2D images and produce 3D models 
Develop a GAN to do style transfer with Pix2Pix

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
docker volume ls -q -f driver=nvidia-docker | xargs -r -I{} -n1 docker ps -q -a -f volume={} | xargs -r docker rm -f
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers, and deep learning practitioners looking for a quick reference to tackle challenges and tasks in the GAN domain. Familiarity with machine learning concepts and working knowledge of Python programming language will help you get the most out of the book.
